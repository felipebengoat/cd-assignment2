"Fellow Brave Lucho Mitrovitch,
c/o Chilean Ski Team,
Sun Valley, Idaho.

My dear Fellow Brave Senor Mitrovitch:

I have the honor of admonishing you of your election to membership in the Great American Prospectors Association. You were elected to membership by the unanimous vote of all present at the meeting on account of the wonderful work you are doing for Society.

Your suggestions from time to time as to how we may best serve the prospector will be greatly appreciated.

May we prospectors long endure. May we know unlimited success. In fact, I hope we all get lousy rich.

Seriously, Fellow Brave Mitrovitch, I hope that 1941 will be the finest year you have had in the way of health, wealth and happiness.

Trusting this reaches you without undue delay, I have the honor, My dear Fellow Brave Mitrovitch, to be

Your most obedient servant,

Geo. H. Watson
Mayor of Romantic Alta
Scribe of the Great American Prospectors Association
and
President, Alta United Mines Company
