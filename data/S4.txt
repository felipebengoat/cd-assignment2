SHIRAZ AND PERSEPOLIS IN IRAN; TYR, SIDON,
BAALBEK IN LEBANON

I thank Prof. Dietz and Mrs Daves, the hostess for providing me with the opportunity of presenting my Slide Show on Afghanistan, and less in depth on Iran and Lebanon.

In 1972-73 I visited twice, mostly the North of that beautiful country and its lovely people. The purpose of those visits were while working in THE WORLD BANK as part of a team working on an appraisal of the potential in tourism in Afghanistan, that could help that country very much with more hard currency and local work opportunities. At that time HRH Mohammed Zahir Shah was King. I became a very good friend of his brother, Prince Wali Khan Shah when he discovered that we had studied architecture at the same school in Vienna, Austria. Later the greed for power of the King's cousin deposed him, and successive political intrigue for power degenerated into the invasion of Afghanistan by Russia, and brought undeserved suffering and struggle for freedom for those people that have that admirable combination of being proud, brave and extremely kind ..... With a per capita income as low as $65 they were very happy, because by tradition they had learned to be selfsufficient on that low income. The Consumer Economy through its persistent propaganda to encourage to buy goods would have made the people very unhappy, as with such low income they would never be able to purchase those goods. But fate had for them something much worse, that was communism and war.

HISTORY and GEOGRAPHY

Great part of Afghanistan is part of the HINDUKUSH MOUNTAIN RANGE--a continuation of the Himalayas--1920 mi. long and an average hight of its peaks of 5000m or 16000 f.

The PREHISTORIC MAN according to the research of french archeologists is supposed to have lived in North Afghanistan 50,000 years ago.

The cities of DEHMORASI + MUNDIGA, North of Afghanistan on the river OXUS - that today borders Russia — just as MOHENJODARO and HARRAPA on the river Indus, had blooming trade from 2500 to 1350 BC, the very early result of their need of supply of the village farmers while the Cities provided them with economic supply. One of the main products of trade was Lapis. DEHMORASI desapeared 1500 BC because of a shift of the Oxus river, MUNDIGA 500 years later because of wars and invasions.

ZOROASTER or ZARATHUSTRA was the Great Leader who united the ARIANS, that had emigrated from the East and settled in Afghanistan 1000 to 600 BC. He encouraged Agriculture and so the land BACTRIA prospered. Successive migrations of ARIANS from the East Trans Oxiana, finding Afghanistan occupied by the Vedic Arians, moved into the IRAN Plateau, and eventually strecthed from the border of Greece to the Indus River. Many ORCHAEMENIC Kings ruled, but the Zoroastran remained their Religion.

When DARIUS I, 522 to 486 BC, conquered Afghanistan - this is interesting because it was him that built Persepolis, that we will see in my slides when we get to actual Iran - then this King built roads that crossed Afghanistan, that served for migrations of countless tribes West and invasions, and most important for the SILK RTE. and other trades from China to Rome.

HINDUKUSH

This valley ...and the 5 BAND I AMIR Lakes 10000 feet high was where the SILK ROUTE crossed Afghanistan from the West into BAMlYAN 148 miles over the SHIBAR PASS to KABUL, the capital, and then through the KHYBER PASS to Pakistan, and so on to China.

The BUDDHAS were built 400 or 500 AD, when the TRADE flourished between the Caesars in Rome and the HAN Dinasties in China. The small BUDDHA 125 feet was the first to be built, may be 300 AD by the Moguls. It was sculptured on the rock, then coatmoldered with straw and mud, and then stucco that was painted bright blue, the face arms, and hands were gold leaf with semi precious stones.
The 2d. Buddha, 172 feet high had wood studs introduced to the rock, thik ropes attached, moldered to it the coat with stucco painted bright red, the rest same as the other. Then came the dark ages of the Ghaznavids, that under the banner of Islam, destroid all the faces of the Buddhas.

THE RED CITY, 1100 to 1200 AD, 17 km. 11 mi. Bamiyan between the rivers Bamiyan and Kulu it protected the entrance to the valley of Bamiyan, and its very properous rich city that carried its name, with King palace, sumptous villas and lush gardens. While in peace 500 soldiers, under war 2 to 3000. First Stage, square towers with wood planks and loopholes for the soldiers to shot arrows. Second Stage, Halls, eating and sleeping quarters. Third top Stage, warehouses and stables etc...

In 1221 AD the Mongols under the leadership of GENGHIS KAHN, he sent his favorite Grandson to take over the Red city Fortress. Because of its inexpugnability he could not enter it, but got mortally killed. In revenge Ghenghis Khan got together an army of 200,000. A traitor told him of the hidden supply of water to the fortress, and the garrison eventually was forced to surrender. Consecuently Genghis stormed and devasteted to the ground the City of Bamiyam, you can still see the ruins of the King's palace.
