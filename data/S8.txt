Lucho had the information from Tourism Projects Department of The World Bank, that since the second half of 1976 the cost of construction in Jordan has decreased, due to cheap labor coming from Lebanon that has filled the gap created by the Jordanian labor migration to Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, because too much housing development has been going on during the last years, there is a surplus of apartments for rent and very little construction going on.

The Bank estimates the actual cost of construction of a AA 1/2 hotel without movable furniture, movable equipment and miscellaneous supplies is around US $ 658/m²
