Dear Lucho:

I have received an invitation for the wedding of Sonia Edwards on September 9th, and would like to send her flowers.

Would you be kind enough to do this for me? I enclose herewith a 500-peso note with which please do the best you can, also a card to be enclosed. I hope this reaches you safely.

I should like to send a present but am afraid to do so because of the import duties, or other formalities that might be involved.

Phil and I still remember with pleasure the pleasant dinner at your house, and your kind hospitality, as well as our late and rather distraught arrival. I hear from friends that you are having a somewhat more wintry winter than when we visited you last year.

With kind regards to you and Mrs. Mitrovic, and hoping to see you again before too long, and with thanks for your help in this matter, I am

Sincerely yours,
Roland
